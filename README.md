# NYC Green Taxis - Optimizing Revenue

## Business Context

Green taxis in NYC serve outer boroughs and airports. The business team wants to analyze monthly revenue patterns, pickup/drop-off hotspots, and driver performance to uncover areas of optimization.

The executive sponsor is especially interested in:

· Revenue differences between July and August

· Trends in tipping behavior

· Popular zones by trip count and revenue

· Anomalies or patterns in trip distances and durations

They now have two months of data (July and August 2021) and want your team to build a model that scales and supports month-over-month analysis.
